## Usage
When using this page you will be prompted to click the button to produce a new password. The default password, with no user input, is a lowercase, single word password that is generated from a small JSON file containing different types of fruits and vegetables. The user has the option to select if they want numbers, how many words they want, if they want it to be uppercase (Pascal Case, or All Caps), and how many special characters they want their password to contain. All user input is validated server-side, and any input outside of the normal bounds will produce an error message directing the user to provide a valid input.
## Dependencies
The website has no outside dependencies besides user input.
